## History

![](images/Lotka.jpg){fig-alt="Alfred J. Lotka" fig-align="left" width=20%}

Alfred J. Lotka (1880-1949) was born to French-speaking American parents in Lemberg (then part of the Habsburg empire, now Lviv, Ukraine). He studied in France, Germany and England, receiving a BSc in 1901 and a DSc in 1912 from Birmingham university. He moved to the US in 1902, and worked at the US Patent office, as an editor of Scientific American, and as a statistician at the Metropolitan Life Insturance Company in NYC. He wrote more than a hundred papers and five books, spanning a wide range of topics. He's best known for the book *Elements of Physical Biology*, his contributions to demography, and one of the first studies dealing with bibliometrics. 

Starting in 1910, he investigated coupled differential equations relating to chemical as well as ecological dynamics. In 1920 he studied a system of two ODEs that gave rise to perpetual oscillations: *"It was, therefore, with considerable surprise that the writer, on applying his method to certain special cases, found these to lead to undamped, and hence indefinitely continued, oscillations."* He went on to describe *"1. A species of organism $S_1$, a plant species, say, deriving its nourishment from a source presented in such large excess that the mass of the source may be considered constant during the period of time with which we are concerned. 2. A species $S_2$, for example a herbivorous animal species, feeding on $S_1$."* 

The equations he had derived (and then studied in more detail) are now called Lotka-Volterra equations.

![](images/Volterra.jpg){fig-alt="Vito Volterra" fig-align="left" width=20%}

Vito Volterra (1860-1940) was born in Ancona (then part of the Papal State) in a poor Jewish family. The financial situation precipitated with the death of his father, when Vito was two. Vito and his mother went to live with relatives in Turin and then Florence. Volterra showed amazing mathematical talent at a very young age. Antonio Roiti, professor of physics in Florence, noticed the budding mathematician and hired him as his assistant, so that he could continue his studies. He went on to enroll at the Scuola Normale in Pisa, receiving a degree in Physics in 1882. At age 23 he was made full professor of Rational Mechanics in Pisa, and then in 1900 of Mathematical Physics in Rome. For thirty years, he contributed important studies in mathematics, and enriched academic life in Italy (for example, he was the first director of the National Center for Research). In 1931 he refused to take an oath of loyalty to the fascist regime (only 12 professors out of 1250 refused), and was therefore forced to resign (his take on the fascist enterprise: *"Empires die, but Euclid's theorems keep their youth forever"*). 

His interest in mathematical ecology is due to Umberto D'Ancona (his son-in-law), who had studied the trends in fisheries in the Adriatic sea before and immediately after WWI. In 1914-1918 fisheries in the Adriatic had stopped completely because of the conflict. D'Ancona had noticed that, while herbivorous fish had remained about constant, the piscivorous fish had increased dramatically in number. The problem piqued Volterra, who immediately published a sophisticated study, proposing the same equations studied by Lotka. In a short letter to Nature 1926, he stated the so-called "Volterra's Effect" (which he termed "Law III"): *"a complete closure of the fishery was a form of 'protection' under which the voracious fishes were much the better and prospered accordingly, but the ordinary food-fishes, on which these are accustomed to prey, were worse off than before."* This brief paper was a summary of a much more extensive study published in Italian.

### Lotka-Volterra interactions

In 1927, Lotka wrote to Nature to raise the issue that the equations studied by Volterra and the figures presented in Volterra's brief article were identical to those found in *Elements of Physical Biology* (published in 1925). He concluded: *"It would be gratifying if Prof. Volterra's publication should direct attention to a field and method of inquiry which apparently has hitherto passed almost unnoticed."*

Volterra graciously conceded *"I recognize his priority, and am sorry not to have known his work, and therefore not have been able to mention it."* He however listed a few points in which the two authors had pursued different directions, and concluded *"Working independently the one from the other, we have found some common results, and this confirms the exactitude and the interest in the position of the problem. I agree with him in his conclusions that these studies and these methods of research deserve to receive greated attention from scholars, and should give rise to important applications."*

## Equations

We can write the GLV model for $n$ interacting populations in component form
as:

$$
\dfrac{d x_i(t)}{dt} = \dot{x}_i = x_i \left(r_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_j \right)
$$

and in matrix form as:

$$
\dot{x} = D(x) \left(r + Ax \right)
$$

where $x = x(t)$ is a (column) vector of length $n$ containing the
densities of all populations $1, \ldots, n$ at time $t$, $r$ is a vector
of *intrinsic growth rates* (or death rates, when negative), measuring
the growth (decline) of population $i$ when growing alone at low
density, and $A$ is a $n \times n$ matrix of *interaction coefficients*.
We use $D(x)$ to denote the diagonal matrix with $x$ on the diagonal.

Sometimes the model is written in a slightly different way, by bringing
the vector $r$ outside the parenthesis:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}_i &= x_i \left(r_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_j \right)\\
&= r_i x_i \left(1 + \frac{1}{r_i} \sum_j A_{ij} x_j\right)\\
&= r_i x_i \left(1 + \sum_j B_{ij} x_j\right)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where we have defined $B_{ij} = A_{ij} / r_i$. In matrix form, we
obtain:

$$
\dot{x} = D(x \circ r) \left(1_n + Bx \right)
$$

where $\circ$ is the Hadamard (element by element) product. This
notation is convenient when computing the equilibria of the system; the
previous notation is more convenient when investigating their stability.
We will alternate between the two notations, using $A$ and
$B = D(r)^{-1} A$ for the two matrices.

## Equilibria

If an equilibrium $x^\star$ in which all populations are present exists,
it must be the solution of

$$
\begin{aligned}
1_n + Bx^\star &= 0_n\\
Bx^\star &= - 1_n\\
x^\star &= -B^{-1} 1_n
\end{aligned}
$$

when the matrix $B$ is invertible. Naturally, the equilibrium must be positive (called *feasible*) to be biologically attainable.

For example, consider:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
-4 & -1 & -3\\
-14 & -8 & -10\\
-6 & -15 & -13
\end{pmatrix} \quad r = \begin{pmatrix}
8\\
32\\
34
\end{pmatrix}\quad B = D(r)^{-1}A = \begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{8} & -\frac{3}{8}\\
-\frac{7}{16} & -\frac{1}{4} & -\frac{5}{16}\\
-\frac{3}{17} & -\frac{15}{34} & -\frac{13}{34}
\end{pmatrix}
$$ 
There is an equilibrium when at which all populations are present:

$$
x^\star = -A^{-1} r = -B^{-1}1_n = \begin{pmatrix}
1\\
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
If the matrix $B$ is rank-deficient (and thus singular) there are infinitely many equilibria; for example, if the rank of $B$ is $n-1$ there are infinitely many equilibria belonging to a line in $\mathbb R^n$.

When $B$ is nonsingular, the model admits at most one positive equilibrium in which all populations are present. However, there can be up to $2^n-1$ equilibria in which *one or more populations are absent/extinct*. Call $B^{(k,k)}$ the submatrix of $B$ obtained by retaining the rows and columns indexed by the set $k$. Then by solving

$$
B^{(k,k)} x^{(k)\star} = -1_{\|k\|}
$$

we obtain an equilibrium for the subcommunity where only the populations in $k$ are present (provided that the equilibrium is feasibile).

For the example above, we have:

$$
B^{(\{1,2\},\{1,2\})} = \begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2}& -\frac{1}{8}\\
-\frac{7}{16} & -\frac{1}{4}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

and

$$
x^{(\{1,2\})\star} = -(B^{(\{1,2\},\{1,2\})})^{-1}1_2=\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{16}{9}\\
\frac{8}{9}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Therefore, the subsystem in which only the first two populations are present yields a feasible equilibrium.

Similarly,

$$
x^{(\{1,3\})\star} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{17}\\
\frac{44}{17}
\end{pmatrix} \quad x^{(\{1\})\star} = \begin{pmatrix}
2\\
\end{pmatrix} \quad x^{(\{2\})\star} = \begin{pmatrix}
4\\
\end{pmatrix} \quad x^{(\{3\})\star} = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{34}{13}\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The subsystem in which only populations 2 and 3 are present does not yield a feasible equilibrium.

## Types of dynamics

For a single population, the GLV model can yield only two outcomes: unbounded growth, or convergence to an equilibrium; if the equilibrium is $x^\star = 0$, we say that the population is extinct at the equilibrium.

When we have two populations, we can also observe neutral cycles (as in the classic LV predator-prey system), and bistability (i.e., one population survives, while the other goes extinct; the identity of the population going extinct depends on the initial conditions).

## Equilibrium as time-average

Suppose that $x(t)$ has a periodic orbit, of period $T$ (i.e., we assume
$x(0) = x(T)$). Further, assume that the GLV has a feasible, interior
equilibrium $x^\star$. We want to calculate the average density for each
population:

$$
\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T x(t) dt
$$

First, we assume that $x(t) > 0$ and write the dynamics of its
logarithm:

$$
\dfrac{d \log(x_i(t))}{dt} = \dfrac{1}{x_i(t)}\dfrac{d x_i(t)}{dt} = r_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_j(t)
$$

In vector form:

$$
\dfrac{d \log{x(t)}}{dt}= r + A x(t)
$$

Compute the average on both sides:

$$
\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \frac{d \log(x(t))}{dt} dt= \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \left(r + Ax(t) \right) dt
$$

yielding:

$$
\frac{1}{T}(\log(x(T)) - \log(x(0))) = 0_n = r + A \left( \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T x(t) dt \right)
$$

Note that the l.h.s. is zero because $x(0) = x(T)$. Now rearrange:

$$
-r = A \left( \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T x(t) dt \right)
$$

Multiplying by the matrix inverse:

$$
-A^{-1} r = x^\star =  \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T x(t) dt 
$$

showing that *the average density is* in fact *the equilibrium*. With a similar argument, one can prove that if the trajectory stays in a compact space (i.e., in case of chaotic attractors), then the long-time average is still $x^\star$.

## Coexistence requires a feasible equilibrium

A necessary condition for the coexistence of populations is the existence of a positive (feasible) equilibrium.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Farkas' lemma

Consider matrix $A$, of size $n \times n$, and the vector $b$, of length $n$. 

Then either:

$$
\exists x \geq 0_n \quad \mid \quad Ax = b 
$$

or:

$$
\exists y \in \mathbb R^n \quad \mid \quad A^T y \geq 0 \;\text{and}\; b^T y < 0 
$$
:::

Suppose that the system does not have a feasible equilibrium, i.e., an $x^\star > 0_n$ such that $Ax^\star = -r$. Then, there must exist a $y$ such that $A^T y \geq 0_n$ and $r^T y > 0$. 

But then, consider the function:

$$
P = \prod_i x_i^{y_i}
$$

The function is positive when all $x_i > 0$. Differentiating with respect to time, we find:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{P} &= \sum_i\left( y_i \dot{x}_i x_i^{y_i - 1} \prod_{j \neq i} x_j^{y_j} \right)\\
&=\sum_i\left( y_i \frac{\dot{x}_i}{x_i} \prod_{j} x_j^{y_j} \right)\\
&= P \sum_i y_i \left(r_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_j\right)\\
&= P (y^T r + y^T A x)
\end{aligned}
$$

but by Farkas' lemma, we have that $y^T r > 0$  and $y^TA > 0_n^T$; then $P$ always grows in time, and eventually diverges to $\infty$. 

Note that $P(t) \to \infty$ requires some $x_i^{y_i}(t) \to \infty$, which happens when either $x_i(t) \to \infty$ and $y_i > 0$ (i.e., a population grows without bound), or $x_i(t) \to 0$ and $y_i < 0$ (i.e., a population goes extinct). Thus, in the absence of an equilibrium, trajectories can either diverge to infinity, or one or more populations can go extinct.

A feasible equilibrium is therefore a necessary condition for coexistence.

## Local stability

We want to determine whether an equilibrium point is locally
asymptotically stable; this means that, for sufficiently small
perturbations of the equilibrium, $x(0) = x^\star + \epsilon$, we have
that $\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = x^\star$. Let's start by considering
the case of a single population:

-   Take an ODE $dx/dt = f(x)$
-   The population is resting at an equilibrium $x^\star$
-   We perturb the population abundance, and track the dynamics when
    starting at $x(0) = x^\star + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ (the
    perturbation) is taken to be sufficiently small
    $\| \epsilon \| \ll 1$
-   We write $\Delta x(0) = x(0) - x^\star$
-   We derive the dynamics for $\Delta x$.

By chain rule,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{d \Delta x}{dt} &= \dfrac{d \Delta x}{dx} \dfrac{d x}{dt} \\
&= 1 \dfrac{d x}{dt}\\
&= f(x)\\
&= f(\Delta x + x^\star)
\end{aligned}
$$

Where we have substituted $x = \Delta x + x^\star$.

-   Now we approximate the function $f(\Delta x + x^\star)$ by
    Taylor-expanding.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Taylor series

We can approximate the behavior of a (infinitely differentiable)
function in the vicinity of a point $a$ by a power series:

$$
f(x) = f(a) + \dfrac{1}{1!} \left. \dfrac{df(x)}{dx} \right|_a (x-a)+ \dfrac{1}{2!} \left. \dfrac{d^2f(x)}{dx^2} \right|_a (x-a)^2+ \dfrac{1}{3!} \left. \dfrac{d^3f(x)}{dx^3} \right|_a (x-a)^3 + \ldots
$$

where $n! = n (n-1)(n-2)\ldots 1$ is the factorial function and the
derivatives are evaluated at $a$. When we choose $a=0$, this is called
the Maclaurin series.

**Example**

Expand $e^x$ around $0$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
e^x &= e^0 + \left. e^x\right|_0 x + \frac{1}{2}\left. e^x\right|_0 x^2  + \frac{1}{6}\left. e^x\right|_0 x^3 + \ldots\\
&=1 + x + \frac{1}{2} x^2  + \frac{1}{6}x^3 + \ldots\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

We want to Taylor-expand $f(x) = f(\Delta x + x^\star)$ around
$x^\star$:

$$
f(x) = f(x^\star) + \left.\dfrac{d f(x)}{d x}\right|_{x^\star} (x - x^\star) + \dfrac{1}{2}\left.\dfrac{d^2 f(x)}{d x^2}\right|_{x^\star} (x - x^\star)^2 + \ldots
$$

Note that $f(x^\star) = 0$ by the definition of an equilibrium. If the
deviation is small, we can neglect all the higher-order terms,
obtaining:

$$
\dfrac{d \Delta x}{dt} = f(x) \approx \left.\dfrac{d f(x)}{d x}\right|_{x^\star} \Delta x 
$$

which is the equation of the exponential growth model, with
$\rho = \left.\dfrac{d f(x)}{d x}\right|_{x^\star}$. Then, the solution
is $\Delta x(t) = \Delta x(0) e^{\rho t}$, and the deviation from the
equilibrium eventually reaches zero (i.e., the system goes back to
$x^\star$) whenever $\rho < 0$.

For example, take the logistic growth model $\dot{x} = x(1-x)$, and
evaluate the stability of $x^\star = 1$; we have:

$$
\left.\dfrac{d f(x)}{d x}\right|_{x^\star} = \left.\dfrac{d (x - x^2)}{d x}\right|_{x^\star} = \left.(1 - 2x)\right|_{x^\star} = -1
$$

and thus the equilibrium is *locally asymptotically stable*. Locally,
because we have considered very small deviations from the equilibrium,
and asymptotic because convergence only happens eventually.

In analogy with the Taylor-expansion of functions of a single variable,
we can write:

$$
f_i(x^\star + \Delta x) = f_i(x^\star) + \sum_k \left. \dfrac{\partial f_i(x)}{\partial x_k} \right|_{x^\star} \Delta x_k + \dfrac{1}{2} \sum_{k}\sum_{l} \left. \dfrac{\partial^2 f_i(x)}{\partial x_k \partial x_l} \right|_{x^\star} \Delta x_k \Delta x_l + \cdots
$$

As before, $f_i(x^\star) = 0$, and if we take only the second term
(i.e., the term linear in $\Delta x$) we can approximate the function
as:

$$
f_i(x^\star + \Delta x) \approx \sum_k \left. J_{ik} \right|_{x^\star} \Delta x_k
$$

Where we have defined the *Jacobian* matrix $J$:

$$
J_{ij} = \dfrac{\partial f_i(x)}{\partial x_j}
$$

For each equilibrium of the system, we can obtain a different *community
matrix* (the name is due to Richard Levins) $M$:

$$
M = \left. J \right|_{x^\star}
$$

As such, a system of ODEs has a *single* Jacobian, and as many community
matrices as there are equilibria. As before, we assume that we have
slightly perturbed the system at equilibrium,
$x(t) = x^\star + \Delta x$, where $\Delta x$ is assumed to be small,
and then we approximate the dynamics:

$$
\dfrac{d\Delta x}{dt} \approx \left. J \right|_{x^\star} \Delta x
$$

i.e., we need to solve a linear system of ODEs.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Solving systems of linear ODEs

Consider the system of first-order, autonomous ODEs:

$$
\dfrac{dx}{dt} = Ax
$$

If the matrix $A$ is diagonalizable, we can decompose the matrix as:

$$
A = Q \Lambda Q^{-1}
$$

We define a new system of equations, by changing the variables:

$$
y = Q^{-1}x\quad x = Q y
$$

Then, by chain rule:

$$
\dfrac{dy}{dt} = Q^{-1} \dfrac{d x}{dt} = Q^{-1}Q \Lambda Q^{-1} x= \Lambda Q^{-1} x = \Lambda y
$$

We have decoupled all equations: now the $y_i$ grow or decline
independently of each other.

$$
\dfrac{dy_i}{dt} = \lambda_i y_i
$$

This is in fact the equation for the exponential growth/decay, with
solution $y_i(t) = y(0) e^{\lambda_i t}$.

We can bring these solutions back to the original form:

$$
y(t) = e^{\Lambda t} y(0)
$$

where $e^{\Lambda t}$ is a diagonal matrix:

$$
e^{\Lambda t}= \begin{pmatrix}
e^{\lambda_1 t} & 0 & \cdots &0\\
0 & e^{\lambda_2 t} & \cdots &0\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots\\
0 & 0 & \cdots & e^{\lambda_n t}\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Then:

$$
x(t) = Q y(t) = Q e^{\Lambda t} y(0) = Q e^{\Lambda t} Q^{-1} x(0)
$$

Allowing to easily compute the solution for any linear systems of ODEs.

**Stability of the origin**

Suppose that $\lambda_i$ is a real, negative number; then
$\lim_{t \to \infty}e^{\lambda_i t} = 0$. If $\lambda_i$ is positive, on
the other hand, then $\lim_{t \to \infty}e^{\lambda_i t} = \infty$.
Thus, if any of the $\lambda_i > 0$, the system will initially move
toward $\infty$ in the direction specified by the corresponding
eigenvector.

Whenever $\lambda_i$ is complex (e.g., generically, when $A$ is not
symmetric), then we need to consider:

$$
e^{\alpha t + i \beta t} = e^{\alpha t} e^{i \beta t} = e^{\alpha t} (\cos \beta + i \sin \beta )t
$$

where we have used Euler's formula. Importantly,
$(\cos \beta + i \sin \beta )$ is bounded, and in fact its real
(imaginary) part is $\leq 1$ (the equation describes a unit circle in
the complex plane). Then,
$\lim_{t \to \infty} e^{\alpha t + i \beta t} = 0$ if $\alpha < 0$.

Therefore, the vector $0_n$ is an asymptotically stable equilibrium of
the system $\dfrac{dx}{dt} = A x$ if and only if *all* the eigenvalues
of $A$ have negative real part.

**Stability of the origin for** $A_{2 \times 2}$

As we have shown above, the eigenvalues of a $2\times2$ matrix $A$:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

are:

$$
\lambda = \dfrac{a + d \pm \sqrt{4bc + (a-d)^2}}{2}
$$

We can rewrite the values as:

$$
\lambda = \dfrac{1}{2} \left(\text{Tr}A \pm\sqrt{\left(\text{Tr}A \right)^2 - 4 \det A} \right)
$$

If the trace is negative, and the determinant positive, then the
eigenvalues have negative real part, and thus the origin is stable for
the corresponding system of linear ODEs. In fact, knowing the trace and
the determinant is in this case sufficient to determine the type of
dynamics around equilibrium:

![Characterizing dynamics using trace and
determinant](images/Stability_Diagram.png){width="600"}
:::

To probe the local asymptotic stability of the equilibria, we can:

-   Calculate the Jacobian matrix, $J$
-   Plug in an equilibrium, obtaining the corresponding community matrix
    $M$
-   Compute the eigenvalues of $M$, $\lambda_i$
-   If *all* the eigenvalues have negative real part,
    $\Re (\lambda_i) < 0$, then the equilibrium is locally
    asymptotically stable; if *any* $\Re (\lambda_i) > 0$, then the
    equilibrium is unstable, and there are small perturbations that will
    amplify (at least initially)

For the GLV system with equilibrium $x^\star = -A^{-1}r > 0_n$, we have:

$$
J_{ii} = \dfrac{\partial (r_i x_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_i x_j)}{\partial x_i}  = r_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_j + A_{ii} x_i
$$

At equilibrium, we have:

$$
r_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_j^\star = 0
$$

and therefore

$$
M_{ii} = \left. J_{ii} \right|_{x^\star} = A_{ii} x_i^\star
$$

Similarly,

$$
J_{ii} = \dfrac{\partial (r_i x_i + \sum_j A_{ij} x_i x_j)}{\partial x_j}  = A_{ij} x_i
$$

and thus

$$
M_{ij} = \left. J_{ij} \right|_{x^\star} = A_{ij} x_i^\star
$$

Putting them together, we obtain:

$$
M = \left. J \right|_{x^\star} = D(x^\star)A
$$

and thus the equilibrium is l.a.s. if and only if all of the eigenvalues
of $D(x^\star)A$ have negative real part.

If the matrix $A$ is symmetric, any feasible equilibrium is stable if
and only if the eigenvalues of $A$ are all negative (i.e., $A$ is
negative definite). To prove this, take $A = A^T$ and consider the
similarity transformation

$$
\begin{aligned}
D(x^\star)^{-\frac{1}{2}} D(x^\star) A D(x^\star)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
D(x^\star)^{\frac{1}{2}}  A D(x^\star)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

The matrices $D(x^\star) A$ and
$D(x^\star)^{\frac{1}{2}} A D(x^\star)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ are *similar*, and
thus have the same eigenvalues; the matrices $A$ and
$D(x^\star)^{\frac{1}{2}} A D(x^\star)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ are *congruent*,
and thus have the same number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues
by Sylvester's law of inertia.

A symmetric matrix is negative definite if all its submatrices obtained
by deleting a set of rows and the corresponding columns are negative
definite as well. Then, if $A = A^T$ is negative definite, a) a feasible
equilibrium is locally stable, and b) for any subsystem, feasibility
implies local stability.

Note that this is generally not the case for nonsymmetric matrices $A$,
in which case we could have that $A$ has all eigenvalues with a negative
real part, while $D(x^\star)A$ has some eigenvalues with positive real
part (or viceversa). For example, take

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
-3 & 4 & 0\\
5 & -2 & -2\\
5 & 5 & -3
\end{pmatrix} \quad \lambda(A) = \{-7,\frac{1}{2}(-1 \pm i \sqrt{15}) \}
$$

and the equilibrium $x^\star = (1,1,1/2)^T$ (obtained for
$r = (-1, -2, -17/2)$); we obtain:

$$
M = D(x^\star)A = \begin{pmatrix}
-3 & 4 & 0\\
5 & -2 & -2\\
\frac{5}{2} & \frac{5}{2} & -\frac{3}{2}
\end{pmatrix} \quad \lambda(B) = \{-7,\frac{1}{4}(1 \pm i\sqrt{31}) \}
$$

Thus, the equilibrium is not locally asymptotically stable.

## Global asymptotic stability

In certain models, we can show that whenever all the populations start at a
positive value, they will always reach a certain equilibrium $x^\star$.
In this case, we say the equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.

Because solving differential equations is in general very
difficult, and in many cases of interest impossible, we employ a proxy
function, called a Lyapunov function.

## Lyapunov functions

We want to prove that all trajectories originating at $x(0) > 0$
eventually converge to $x^\star$. If we can find a function $V$ such
that:

-   $V(x(t)) \geq 0$ for all $x(t) > 0$
-   $V(x(t)) = 0$ if and only if $x(t) = x^\star$
-   $\dfrac{d V(x(t))}{dt} \leq 0$ for all $x(t)$ and
-   $\dfrac{d V(x(t))}{dt} = 0$ if and only if $x(t) = x^\star$

then $x^\star$ is globally asymptotically stable: all trajectories
starting at a positive point will converge to it.

The logic of this procedure is to identify a suitable function $V$ that
is positive everywhere but at the equilibrium, and is always declining
in time; then necessarily the function will eventually reach zero, which
is attained only at equilibrium.

**Example**

$V(x(t)) = (x(t) - x^\star)^2$ is a Lyapunov function for the logistic
growth model $dx/dt = x(1-x)$: the model has an equilibrium
$x^\star = 1$ that is globally asymptotically stable.

-   $V(x(t))$ is always nonnegative, and is zero only at
    $x(t) = x^\star = 1$
-   The derivative of $V(x(t))$ w.r.t. time is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{dV(t)}{dt} &= \dfrac{dV(t)}{dx(t)}\dfrac{dx(t)}{dt}\\
&= 2(x(t) - x^\star)\dfrac{dx(t)}{dt}\\
&=-2(x(t)-1) x(t)(x(t)-1)\\
&=-2 x(t) (x(t)-1)^2 \leq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

There are two classic candidate Lyapunov functions for Lotka-Volterra
models. The first is due to MacArthur, and shows that, when interactions
are symmetric and the matrix of interactions is negative definite (i.e.,
has only negative eigenvalues), the feasible equilibrium is globally
stable.

We consider a slightly modified version of MacArthur's function, and
assume $A = A^T$:

$$
W(x) = r^Tx^\star - (2 r^T x + x^T A x) 
$$

Whenever $A$ is negative definite, then $W(x(t))$ is positive everywhere
but at equilibrium (the function is convex), and has a single minimum at
the equilibrium. Note that, whenever $x^\star > 0_n$ is an equilibrium,
then

$$
\begin{aligned}
r + A x^\star &= 0_n\\
r &= -Ax^\star
\end{aligned}
$$

Substitute these values in the function $W$, to obtain:

$$
\begin{aligned}
W(x^\star) &= r^Tx^\star - (2 r^T x^\star + (x^\star)^T A x^\star) \\
&=r^Tx^\star - (2 r^T x^\star + ((x^\star) A)^T x^\star)\\
&=r^Tx^\star - (2 r^T x^\star -r^T x^\star)\\
&=0_n
\end{aligned}
$$

Differentiating with respect to time, we find:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{W}(x(t)) &= -(2 r^T \dot{x} + \dot{x}^T A x + x^T A \dot{x})\\
&= -(2 r^T \dot{x} + \dot{x}^T A^T x + x^T A \dot{x})\\
&= -2 (r + Ax)^T \dot{x}\\
&= -2 (r + Ax)^T D(x) (r + Ax)\\
&=-2 \sum_i x_i (r_i + (Ax)_i)^2 \leq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

A more general candidate Lyapunov function is due to Goh, and shows
that, whenever there exists a positive diagonal matrix $D(w)$ such that
$D(w)A^T + AD(w)$ is negative definite, then the equilibrium
$x^\star > 0_n$ is globally stable.

We start with the simplest case in which $w = 1_n$ and thus $D(w) = I$.
Take the function

$$
V(x(t)) = \sum_i \left(x_i - x_i^\star - x_i^\star \log \frac{x_i}{x_i^\star} \right)
$$

The function is positive for every $x \in \mathbb {R^n}_+$, because
$z - 1 - \log z \geq 0$ whenever $z > 0$; take $z = x_i / {x_i}^\star$
and then multiply by ${x_i}^\star$ to prove that the function is
nonnegative.

Differentiating with respect to time, we find:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V}(x(t)) &= \sum_i \left(\dot{x}_i - x_i^\star \frac{\dot{x}_i}{x_i} \right)\\
&= \sum_i \left(x_i (r_i + (Ax)_i) - x_i^\star (r_i + (Ax)_i)\right)\\
&=\sum_i \Delta x_i (-(Ax^\star)_i + (Ax)_i )\\
&=\sum_{i,j}\Delta x_i A_{ij} \Delta x_j\\
&=\Delta x^T A \Delta x\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\Delta x^T (A + A^T)\Delta x\\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, if the symmetric part of $A$, $H(A) = \frac{1}{2} (A + A^T)$ is
negative definite, then $\dot{V}(x(t))<0$ for every $\Delta x \neq 0$
and the equilibrium is stable.

To extend the reach of the candidate function, consider the change of
variables:

$$
z_i = x_i / w_i \quad x_i = w_i z_i
$$

with $w_i>0$. This change of variables cannot impact the existence or
stability of equilibria (we are simply changing the units of measure we are using
to measure the density of each population). Then,

$$
\dot{z_i} = \frac{\dot{x}_i}{w_i} = \frac{x_i}{w_i}(r_i + (Ax)_i) = z_i(r_i + (AD(w)z)_i)=z_i(r_i + (\tilde{A}z)_i)
$$

Thus, if $H(\tilde{A}) = \frac{1}{2} (AD(w) + D(w)A^T)$ is negative
definite, the equilibrium is stable.

## Global stability and saturated equilibria

When Goh's function holds, we can prove that dynamics starting from
positive conditions $x(t)>0_n$ will converge to a *saturated
equilibrium* $\tilde{x}$ characterized by two conditions. We have $n$
populations, and at the saturated equilibrium the populations in set $k$
coexist at a globally stable equilibrium, and the remaining populations,
belonging to set $n-k$ are extinct, and cannot re-invade the system
starting from low abundance.

Without loss of generality, we can order the populations such that the
first $\|k\|$ populations are those that coexist at the saturated equilibrium, and the remaining $\| n- k\|$ are those extinct at the saturated equilibrium. We partition all variables according to the two sets:

$$
x = \begin{pmatrix}
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix} \quad \tilde{x} = \begin{pmatrix}
y^\star\\
0_{n-k}
\end{pmatrix} \quad A = \begin{pmatrix}
\mathfrak A & \mathfrak B\\
\mathfrak C & \mathfrak D
\end{pmatrix}\quad r = \begin{pmatrix}
\mathfrak r\\
\mathfrak s
\end{pmatrix}
$$

We consider a minor modification of Goh's function:

$$
V(x (t)) = \sum_{i \in k} \left(y_i - y_i^\star - y_i^\star \log \frac{y_i}{y_i^\star} \right) + 
\sum_{i \in n-k} z_i
$$

Differentiating with respect to time, we obtain:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V}(x(t)) &= \sum_{i \in k} \left(\dot{y}_i - y_i^\star \frac{\dot{y}_i}{y_i} \right)+\sum_{i \in n-k} \dot{z}_i\\
&=\Delta y^T(\mathfrak r + \mathfrak A y + \mathfrak Bz) + z^T(\mathfrak s + \mathfrak C y+ \mathfrak D z)
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we substitute $\mathfrak r = -\mathfrak A y^\star$, and add and subtract $z^T \mathfrak C y^\star$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V}(x(t)) &=\Delta y^T(-\mathfrak A y^\star + \mathfrak A y + \mathfrak Bz) + z^T(\mathfrak s + \mathfrak C y+ \mathfrak D z  + \mathfrak C y^\star - \mathfrak C y^\star)\\
&=\Delta y^T(\mathfrak A \Delta y + \mathfrak Bz) + z^T(\mathfrak s + \mathfrak C \Delta y+ \mathfrak D z  + \mathfrak C y^\star)
\end{aligned}
$$
Now we write the function as the sum of two parts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V}(x(t)) &= (\Delta y^T \mathfrak A \Delta y + \Delta y^T \mathfrak B z + z^T \mathfrak C \Delta y + z^T \mathfrak D z) + z^T(s + \mathfrak C y^\star)\\
&= \begin{pmatrix}
\Delta y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}^T \begin{pmatrix}
\mathfrak A & \mathfrak B\\
\mathfrak C & \mathfrak D
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
\Delta y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}+ z^T(s + \mathfrak C y^\star)\\\\
&= \begin{pmatrix}
\Delta y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}^T A\begin{pmatrix}
\Delta y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}+ z^T(s + \mathfrak C y^\star)\\\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Whenever $H(A) = \frac{1}{2}(A + A^T)$ is negative definite, then the first term is negative for any choice of $y$ and $z$. Examining the second term, we see that $\mathfrak s + \mathfrak C y^\star$ measures the invasion growth rate of the populations in the set $n-k$ when they are attempting to invade the community that is resting at $y^\star$. Thus, if we can find a saturated equilibrium, it is globally stable and will be reached for any $x(0) > 0_n$.

This derivation can be extended by considering a diagonal matrix $D(w)$ with $w >0_n$, as done above.
